# Branch Naming Convention

When working on small projects, a simple and effective branch naming convention can help keep your repository organized. Here's a popular approach:

## Format: `type/description`

- `type`: Indicates the purpose of the branch
- `description`: Brief, hyphenated explanation of the branch contents

### Common Types:
- `feature`: New functionality
- `bugfix`: Fixes for issues
- `hotfix`: Urgent fixes for production
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `refactor`: Code improvements without changing functionality

### Examples:
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/login-error`
- `docs/api-endpoints`
- `refactor/optimize-database-queries`

This convention provides a clear, at-a-glance understanding of each branch's purpose and contents.
